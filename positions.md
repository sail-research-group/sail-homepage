# Open Positions

We are always looking for **curious, motivated, and kind** people to join the **SAIL (System and Architecture for Intelligent Living) Research Group** at the [Department of Engineering](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/engineering), [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/).

If you are excited about **computer architecture, systems, and data-intensive applications** (AI, bioinformatics, etc.), we would be very happy to hear from you.

## 1. PhD Positions

We regularly recruit **PhD students** in the broad areas of:

- **Data-centric computer architecture & systems**
- **Processing-in-Memory (PIM)** and **In-Storage Processing (ISP)**
- **Software–hardware co-design** for AI and bioinformatics
- **Reliable and secure memory/storage systems**

### Example topics

- **PIM/near-data accelerators** for large language models or retrieval-augmented generation  
- **Architectures and runtimes** for real-time genome analysis on edge/portable devices  
- **Reliability and security** of emerging memory and storage technologies  

### What we are looking for

- Strong background in **computer architecture, systems, or related fields**
- Solid programming skills in **C/C++ and/or Python**
- Interest in **research** and **writing** (papers, artifacts, open-source code)
- Ability to work both **independently** and **collaboratively** in a team

### How to apply

1. Check the **official PhD application instructions** on the  
   [KCL postgraduate pages](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate).
2. Prepare:
   - CV (with GPA, publications if any, and projects)
   - Brief research statement (1–2 pages)
   - Transcripts (and English test scores if required)
3. **Before applying**, you are welcome to email  
   **haiyu.mao [at] kcl.ac.uk** with:
   - Your CV
   - A short paragraph about your research interests
   - Any relevant publications / project links

Please use the email subject line:
