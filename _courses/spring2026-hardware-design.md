## Coursework Project

### RISKing 16: A 16-bit RISC CPU

The RISKing16 is a custom 16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor designed specifically for the HAD26 (Hardware Architecture and Design) course at King's College London. It serves as a pedagogical "playground," allowing students to transition from theoretical concepts to practical engineering by building a fully functional CPU from the ground up.

**Core Design Philosophy**

- Unlike complex industry standards like x86 or ARM, RISKing16 focuses on architectural clarity:
- 16-bit Architecture: Features a compact 16-bit datapath and instruction format, optimized for FPGA implementation (like the Basys3 board).
- Load-Store Architecture: Memory is accessed only via explicit LDR and STR instructions, simplifying the internal datapath.
- Full-Stack Development: Students don't just write Verilog; they develop the entire ecosystem, including the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and a custom Assembler.

**Modular Learning**: The project is structured to master individual components—such as the ALU, Register File, and Control Unit—before integrating them into a multi-cycle or pipelined processor.

## Practical Skills

To complement the coursework project and facilitate practical FPGA experience, we have developed three introductory lab demonstrations.
